# gravitational potential FEM solution
This repository contains problem description (in Polish) and program written in Python 3.8 that preproceses the equation matrix (mainly by solving some integrals by Gaussâ€“Legendre quadrature) and solves the system of equations.

# Requirements
Project to work needs 3 aditional libraries:
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib

# instalation
